  A lot of rubbish but the consume at least has a mix ancestor.
  <is>
    <mix>
      <complete>
        Rubbish but there's an element with an id that we're checking...
        <consume id="deep_in_rubbish" name="Consume" fields="field1" service="Service"/>
      </complete>
    </mix>
  </is>
</this>
